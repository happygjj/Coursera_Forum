If an integer, then the result will be a 1-D array of that length. One shape dimension can be -1.

In the first code you provided, we are testing the equality of two functions at a particular x (namely person).\nHere f(x)=lambda(x) (remember x stands for person). In the second one though the lambda's x (or person) argument is not provided which means that python evaluates it as a function not where it is evaluated. So, the second code would be like trying to equate f(x)=lambda() where lambda can take on any value (person in people) that is why it evaluates as false.\nDoes that make sense am I overcomplicating it :)?"

The recommended installation is anaconda 3. more in the pinned thread \"Which version of python is this course in?\"\nI advise learners start familiarising themselves with Jupyter from the start, you will find Resources/Jupyter Notebook FAQ a good place to start.",

We have 234 such values and we average them.\nYou are right. This is similar to list comprehension and in fact you can also return the values in a list comprehension and take its mean using np.nanmean(). I am not sure if that answers the question entirely so keep asking if there is any ambiguity."

                "reply2": "This is still really confusing because the code you gave in this response differs so much from the template given in the exercise. It seems that we are supposed to replace the ??? with our code, but this response suggests we overwrite what is given to start, not that we just replace the ???.",
                "reply3": "Hi Amy, my aim in this piece of code was to illustrate what the right hand side of the equality assignment in option 1 would produce. Obviously, the counterpart to the second option where we use map uses the anaonymous lambda function and people. So, this means that our lambda is evaluated at each person in people list, which is equivalent to what I wrote.\nI know lambda functions can be confusing, so keep asking if there is any ambiguity here.",
                "reply4": "Thanks. I'm not actually sure it's lambda I'm confused about, though. I certainly need to learn more about the syntax. Nothing in the video lecture really went into sufficient detail to cover the code in the in-video activity. I would have expected to write lambda person: ... rather than using x and then (person) at the end, and I wouldn't have used the function above in the loop at all. Although I definitely am new to lambda and need to learn more, my question isn't really about that so much as the structure of the assignment. You're saying what you wrote is equivalent to the right-hand side of the equality assignment in option 1, but that whole equality thing makes no sense to me for a bunch of reasons. For one thing, it appears to use the function defined above, when I thought the whole point of lambda was to avoid that. And while the code you gave in your response runs, making that the right hand side of the equality in option 1 doesn't run at all. So I'm still totally unclear how that code is supposed to be altered only on the right hand side, leaving the left as is, and would run. And I don't understand why you'd have the left hand side at all. So even though I can write something using lambda that accomplishes the goal of the task in a for loop, I can't do it using the code provided at all.",
                "reply5": "So to maybe be a little more clear about my confusion, the original assignment starts with this:\npeople = ['Dr. Christopher Brooks', 'Dr. Kevyn Collins-Thompson', 'Dr. VG Vinod Vydiswaran', 'Dr. Daniel Romero']\ndef split_title_and_name(person):\nreturn person.split()[0] + ' ' + person.split()[-1]\n#option 1\nfor person in people:\nprint(split_title_and_name(person) == (lambda person:???))\nThe following works, without using lambda at all. So if you're going to define the function, why do extra work and introduce a lambda?\nfor person in people:\nprint(split_title_and_name(person))\nIt seems like the way to use lambda for what it's meant for is to skip any reference to the function all, and simply put in the code you indicated. That said, the way the assignment is written, it looks like you're meant to *only* replace the ??? with your code, and leave the rest unaltered. That's what doesn't make sense to me. But maybe that's not the intent. Maybe the point of that line is to say, do something equivalent to print(split_title_and_name(person)) using a lambda function instead. If that's the case it makes sense now, and now I'll know how to interpret what's being asked in theses assignments going forward. But if that's not the point, and you are supposed to leave the left hand side as-is, then I'm very confused about why you would ever do that.",
                "reply6": "Hi Amy, I think the Dr. Brooks aim in this exercise was to show that lambda is indeed an anonymous function (single line) just like any other function you can define. That is why he wants to test the equality of the two functions. He is just doing that for all values of x where f(x) and g(x) are two functions. The following might make it easier to appreciate this: (This will print all Trues if functions are defined the same way).\n1\n2\nfor x in X:\n  print(f(x)==g(x))\nTo answer your questions in general, just like a function is defined by a variable x you can define the lambda with x as an argument and then evaluate that x at person, which is what Dr. Brooks is doing. Couldn't we just have written the function with person as an argument? That would be correct too.\nBut you have to remember f() whatever it is defined by x,y, person and so on still have to be evaluated at a value which is for all person in people. So, the following still is good:\n1\n2\nfor person in people:\n    print((lambda person:person.split()[0] + ' ' + person\n        .split()[-1])(person))\nThe intention here is to show that you can create one line functions to use when you are using apply operations on dataframes. This will come in really handy in advanced courses in this specialization. Please keep asking if there is any ambiguity left.",
                "reply7": "Ooooh, I get it now. I assumed we were just writing the lambda function with the goal of seeing the same output we get by calling the defined function. But it actually makes a lot of sense to test the truth of it. Output for a small number of examples could be equivalent, but miss differences in some special cases. This is much more definite.\nThank you very much for taking the time to read and respond to my questions. This was very helpful."

So, whenever Python sees \"re.sub( \" in the third string it replaces that part of the string with \"re.match\\\\(\" as the documentation (look for re.sub) states that if the replacement (second argument in sub()) is a string which is the case here.

I think re.findall is the function you are looking for here. What I mean is adding * at the end of a regex in re.search makes it automatically useless.\nI also have some difficulty interpreting your second point. The error you get in your github file is because you need to define your ( with a backslash for it to be acceptable by regex. If you don't Python will interpret that as the missing part of the scoping operator (which is mentioned in the 4th course of this specialization).\nAnother thing to note is that you are using unnecessarily complicated regex's especially for this course.

Line 6 speaks of keys, 11 of values. In this example, Christopher Brooks is a key, and brooksch@umich.edu is a value. Then why doesn't iteration of keys show keys? Both show values.\nThat's my problem with this code.\nEdit: I see now that in line 8 print(name) should be used instead of print(x[name]).",

However, `keys()` will only give you the key for each item in the dictionary. You can use that key to get at the value inside the for loop.\nAlso, remember that in Jupyter notebook, state is maintained. That means you can do this:\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\nx = {'Christopher Brooks': 'brooksch@umich.edu', 'Bill Gates': \n    'billg@microsoft.com'}\nfoo = None\nfor name, email in x.items():\n    print(name)\n    print(email)\n    foo = email\n    print(foo)\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\nChristopher Brooks\nbrooksch@umich.edu\nbillg@microsoft.com\nBill Gates\nbillg@microsoft.com\nbillg@microsoft.com\nAnd if I then edit it and remove the assignment to foo, it will still work:\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\nx = {'Christopher Brooks': 'brooksch@umich.edu', 'Bill Gates': \n    'billg@microsoft.com'}\nfor name, email in x.items():\n    print(name)\n    print(email)\n    print(foo)\n    1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\nChristopher Brooks\nbrooksch@umich.edu\nbillg@microsoft.com\nBill Gates\nbillg@microsoft.com\nbillg@microsoft.com",

Although in this case we're in a loop and we know the key exists, if you just did:\n1\nprint(x[\"Jimbo\"]\nyou will get a KeyError exception thrown because that key doesn't exist. Much safer to use:\n1\n2\nprint(x.get(\"Jimbo\"))\nI'd encourage you to continue hacking with dictionaries until it clicks.\nDon't worry, I have never used numpy and I don't know diddly-squat about statistics, so I have a learning curve, too!"

Since I previously assigned test2 = test, when I use the slice assignment later this changes test too.\nPython makes a distinction between mutable (changeable) and immutable (unchangeable) objects.

How do I download and install the Jupyter Notebook system for offline use?\nTo install the Jupyter Notebook system on your own machine, we recommend downloading Anaconda. This will allow you to work on any personal data science projects outside of the Coursera Jupyter Notebooks. Anaconda is a distribution containing Python, the Conda package and environment manager, and many software packages for data science. We recommend installing the Python 3 version, as that is the version we will be using in this course. Once Anaconda is downloaded, you can access the Jupyter Notebooks through the Anaconda Navigator. For more information on downloading Anaconda, visit the Install Documentation."

I would like help understanding them. I'll start with just one in this post.\nIf the above array is called r, slicing it with r[0:6, ::-7] somehow returns the last column of values as a list of 6 lists of 1 value each (see result below). I have no idea how it got to that result. To me, the 0:6 says to take rows 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5, the ::-7 says consider all columns and then count backwards by 7 choosing every seventh value from the array. It sounds like it would start from the beginning position [0,0] since everything but the \"step' is non-negative. Does it somehow start counting backwards from the last value in the array? How does it count -7 when there are only 6 rows and 6 columns?\nHere is what it actually returns\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\narray([[ 5],\n       [11],\n       [17],\n       [23],\n       [29],\n       [35]])",
                "reply1": "ok. I thought there were too many questions for a single thread. Even in this thread my questions were too numerous to all get an answer. But I will combine question in the future as requested.\nI have indeed been trying these things in the Jupyter notebook and also in IDLE. I pasted in my code samples from my experimentation. Maybe I'm just not sufficiently caffeinated, but seeing the system response is not helping me to sort out what it is actually doing. It would be nice to have the array slicing shown in the way a debugger shows it. Or perhaps, to receive an explanation of the behavior.\nMeanwhile I see that y[::-7] == y[::-6] and I don't know how that can be. Seems to me that y[::-7] would be an out of range error -- but Python even allows me to do y[::-99]. Why can you step backwards through a 6 element list in steps of 99 without getting an out of range error? If I tried to do that in a for loop I'd certainly get my wrists slapped.\nI see that if the start and end positions are not specified, Python assumes a positive step integer will step forward from the beginning of the list, and a negative integer will step backward from the end of the list on a one dimensional list. It always begins by returning the first (positive step) or last (negative step) element. But what about a two dimensional array? When it is asked to step backwards through an entire 6x6 array by 7 steps, it returns the first row. Huh? (https://www.coursera.org/learn/python-data-analysis/discussions/weeks/1/threads/zNm0nTrTEeifWAoEAy-2pg)\nRegarding Stack Overflow --- it sometimes has good answers, once you scroll past the endlessly annoying, snarky remarks telling the questioner to rtfm (when they very likely *have* read it and still have questions).",

Run the following code in the notebook to see what python does with lists.

                "reply0": "Hi,\nI am referencing this week's video 'Python Demonstration: Reading and Writing CSV files'\nI downloaded mpg.csv to parse on my own computer, and I am able to use csv.dictreader() to parse the file, and compute things like the average city mileage, or len(mpg), etc. Despite that, when I print the data, the formatting is way off from what I see in the video, mine doesn't even look like a list of dictionaries, despite the fact that I can parse it as such.\nIn the video, when we print the first 3 dictionaries of the list 'mpg,' the output list's dictionaries have newlines for each key/value, and each dictionary is clearly a dictionary, in that it is enclosed in {}, and the key/value pairs are separated by a colon.\nMy output for the first 3 entries of 'mpg' looks like this: [OrderedDict([('', '1'), ('manufacturer', 'audi'), ('model', 'a4'), ('displ', '1.8'), ('year', '1999'), ('cyl', '4'), ('trans', 'auto(l5)'), ('drv', 'f'), ('cty', '18'), ('hwy', '29'), ('fl', 'p'), ('class', 'compact')]), OrderedDict([('', '2'),... and so on.\nNo {} or colons, though Python clearly knows its a dictionary, and while this is really hard to read, the data structure is intact.\nHow can I get it to look like a dictionary? That would make it much easier to parse.\nThanks,\nAbraham",
                "reply1": "That is normal, that is the way an OrderedDict looks when it is serialized as a string in a normal Python interpreter:\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\nd = {'a':1, 'b': 2, 'c':3}\nprint(d)\n# shows: {'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': 3}\nfrom collections import OrderedDict\nod = OrderedDict(d)\nprint(od)\n# OrderedDict([('a', 1), ('b', 2), ('c', 3)])\nInside the Jupyter notebook, however, you are running a special python interpreter (called iPython). iPython performs some black magic in order to make it easier for you to inspect the output interactively... An example of controlling this black magic is when the professor used %precision 2 to limit the number of digits that float fractions will display, this is not part of Python, but iPython.\nYou can get the same fancy formatting in Python if you use the PrettyPrint python package (in fact this is what iPython is probably doing for you):\n1\n2\n3\nfrom pprint import pprint\npprint(my_long_ordered_dict)\n# output will be formatted as you expect",

                "reply1": "Hi there,\nDon't be discouraged. Python is not an easy language, Python is considerably more complex than Java... That said, because of its intuitive syntax, you can do a lot in Python without understanding much of it. You can be very productive and learn more about the language on the way.\nThe first place to start is the Official Python Tutorial: https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/index.html\nAlso, Python comes with its own philosophy and sense of humor (the name Python is from \"Monty Python\"), which you should understand in order to enjoy the language... So, open a Python interpreter and type:\n1\n2\nimport this\nAlso:\n1\n2\nimport antigravity\nEnjoy :)",

The variable u is referring to the rows of the the dataframe and in the next line I insert u in the URL code.\nThe code is as follows:\n# replace l_d_list from the original csv file with the next l_d_list into the URL\nExt = []\nfor i in range(len(df)):\ntry:\nu == df.iloc[i,0]\nb = pd.csv_read(f\"URL/?direList={u}&includeInteractors=true\")\nc=b.reset_index()[['Interactor A', 'Interactor B']]\nexcept NameError:\ncontinue\nExt.append(c)\nUnfortunately, the loop iterates only once through the csv file. As a consequence, I only get the interactions of one director instead of all director interactions. I think the failure is that some directors cannot be find in the database.

                "reply1": "Hi Dennis,\nI think a lot of this has to do with naming. Donaho for instance would probably suggest that academia introduced data science 50 years ago with Tukey. I would suggest there is a modern meaning to the phrase, which is the intersection of computational modeling, statistical modeling, and predictive analytics. And the modern field is being driven by (a) ubiquitous computing, (b) large scale data, and (c) new computational methods which are tractable.\nI think Industry is a big term, and some have been at the forefront of this for awhile, but others have certainly lagged. This is true in Academia as well, of course.\nAs far as innovations in the field, I would say it's certainly split between academia and industry. For instance, much of the deep learning fundamentals were done in academia, much of the toolkit development was done in industry. Take even the editing environment we use, Jupyter notebooks, these were developed originally in academia but have quickly become a much more broadly collaborative project.\nChris",

Here are the reasons:\n1) Lets say you are working with a big code which is importing lots of libraries. There can be a possibility that these libraries might have functions with the same name. So, it may lead to 'overlapping' of functions.\n2) Assume you are reading/reviewing/debugging these two codes:\nCode 1\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n# Note: mylib1, mylib2, fun12() and fun11() are not actual \n    functions &\n# libraries.\nfrom numpy import *\nfrom mylib1 import *      \nfrom mylib2 import *     \na = array([1,2,3])\nb = fun12(1)             \nc = fun11(\"Hello\")    \nCode 2\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n# Note: mylib1, mylib2, fun12() and fun11() are not actual \n    functions &\n# libraries.\nimport numpy as np\nimport mylib1 as mlb1     \nimport mylib2 as mlb2     \na = np.array([1,2,3])\nb = mlb1.fun12(1)        \nc = mlb2.fun11(\"Hello\")\nIn the first code, you will not have any idea whether fun11() function belongs to mylib1 library or mylib2 library. However, the second code will give you a clear idea about the functions and from which libraries they are being imported from. So, the latter one is better choice.\nIf you still have doubts, feel free to ask.",

This will give you Python with lots of usefull libraries including pandas, numpy, scipy, and matplotlib, but also python environments like Jupyter notebook, iPython and Spyder. I have used it in many ways, and with anaconda you can also manage your Python environment.\nHope you can also make good use of it like me. If you have any further questions, don's hesitate to ask."

The sum function sums all outcomes and by deviding the result by the number of elements in mpg you get the evarage. Hope this helps.\nIf you have any further questions, don't hesitate to ask."
